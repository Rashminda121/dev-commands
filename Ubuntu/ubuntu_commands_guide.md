## Additional Notes

- **Command Specificity**: The commands are tailored for Ubuntu, which uses the `apt` package manager. For other Linux distributions (e.g., Fedora with `dnf`, Arch with `pacman`), adjust package management commands accordingly.
- **Safety Precautions**: Use `sudo` cautiously, as it grants elevated permissions. Always back up data before running destructive commands like `rm -rf`.
- **Extending the Cheat Sheet**: Add commands for specific tasks (e.g., `grep`, `awk`, or `systemctl`) or create new sections for development, server management, or security as needed.
- **Documentation Lookup**: Run `man command` (e.g., `man ls`) for detailed documentation on any command.
- **Updates**: This file can be updated with new commands or use cases as you encounter them.
