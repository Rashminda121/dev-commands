# Senior Software Engineering Roadmap

This roadmap is designed to elevate your skills to a senior software engineering level, focusing on system design, cloud infrastructure, performance, security, and leadership. Each month builds on the previous, culminating in portfolio-ready projects and deliverables by December 31, 2025.

---

## üìç System Design & Core Engineering Principles
**Focus**: Architecting scalable, fault-tolerant systems.

### Week 1: System Design Foundations
- Scalability vs Reliability vs Availability.
- CAP Theorem, PACELC, and trade-offs.
- Load balancing techniques (Round Robin, Consistent Hashing).
- Caching strategies (Redis, CDN, write-through/write-back).
- Designing APIs for scale (REST vs gRPC vs GraphQL).

### Week 2: Distributed Systems
- Consensus algorithms (Raft, Paxos, Zookeeper).
- Leader election and gossip protocols.
- Replication strategies (master-slave, leaderless, quorum).
- Partitioning and sharding techniques.

### Week 3: High Availability & Fault Tolerance
- Disaster recovery, failover, and replication.
- Multi-data-center deployment strategies.
- Message queues and event-driven architecture (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Pulsar).

### Week 4: Architecture Patterns
- Microservices vs Monolith vs Modular Monolith.
- Event sourcing, CQRS, and Saga pattern.
- Domain-driven design (DDD).
- Clean architecture, hexagonal, and onion architectures.

**Output**: Create a design document for a real-world scalable system (e.g., Uber, WhatsApp, Netflix).

## üìç Cloud, Infrastructure, and DevOps Mastery
**Focus**: Become cloud-native and infrastructure-savvy.

### Week 1: Cloud & Infrastructure
- Deep dive into AWS/GCP/Azure services for senior engineers.
- Designing VPCs, subnets, and routing.
- Multi-region and disaster recovery strategies.
- Containerization with Docker (advanced concepts).

### Week 2: Kubernetes & Orchestration
- Deploying services with Kubernetes.
- Service mesh implementation (Istio/Linkerd).
- Helm charts and Kubernetes Operators.
- Horizontal vs vertical scaling strategies.

### Week 3: Observability & Monitoring
- Metrics, logs, and tracing (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, OpenTelemetry).
- Defining error budgets, SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs.
- Chaos engineering with tools like Gremlin or LitmusChaos.

### Week 4: DevOps Automation
- Building CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, ArgoCD).
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Pulumi).
- Blue/green and canary deployment strategies.
- Secret management (Vault, AWS KMS).

**Output**: Deploy a microservices app with Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD pipeline, and a monitoring dashboard.

---

## üìç Data, Performance & Security
**Focus**: Senior-level optimization and securing systems.

### Week 1: Database Internals
- SQL internals (B+ Trees, indexes, MVCC).
- NoSQL databases (Cassandra, DynamoDB, MongoDB internals).
- Query optimization and deadlock handling.
- Event-driven data pipelines (Kafka, Debezium).

### Week 2: Performance & Scalability
- Rate limiting and throttling (token bucket, leaky bucket).
- Backpressure handling techniques.
- Leveraging CDNs and edge computing.
- Profiling and benchmarking with APM tools.

### Week 3: Security & Compliance
- Authentication protocols (OAuth2, OIDC, JWT, SAML).
- Web security: OWASP Top 10, CSRF, XSS, SQL injection.
- Implementing Zero Trust Architecture.
- Compliance basics (GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA).

### Week 4: Reliability & Testing
- Resilience patterns (circuit breaker, retry, bulkhead).
- Unit, integration, contract, and E2E testing.
- Property-based and fuzz testing.
- Test automation frameworks.

**Output**: Build a secure, high-performance backend service with rate limiting, monitoring, and authentication.

---

## üìç Leadership, Advanced Topics & Final Integration
**Focus**: Becoming senior beyond coding ‚Äî leadership, scaling orgs, and advanced technologies.

### Week 1: Leadership & Communication
- Writing technical design docs and RFCs.
- Code review best practices.
- Mentorship and knowledge sharing.
- Estimation, planning, and stakeholder management.

### Week 2: Advanced Topics
- Event-driven microservices at scale.
- Data lakes and data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery).
- ML system integration for real-time recommendations.
- Streaming vs batch processing (Flink, Spark).

### Week 3: Scalability at FAANG-level
- Multi-tenant SaaS architecture.
- Handling billions of requests per day.
- Cost optimization at scale (FinOps).
- Feature flags and progressive rollouts.

### Week 4: Capstone
- Design and document an enterprise-grade architecture (choose one):
  - Netflix-like streaming service.
  - Uber-like real-time dispatch system.
  - Slack-like messaging platform.
- Present trade-offs, scaling challenges, and monitoring strategies.

**Output**: Create a portfolio-ready system design and deployment project with a written design document.
